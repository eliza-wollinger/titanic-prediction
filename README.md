# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This program was created as an introductory exploration into the world of data science and programming. It is a project developed for the Digital Innovation One course, offering a beginner-friendly approach to understanding the principles of data science and its application.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this program is to introduce the fundamental concepts and techniques used in data science, particularly in the context of predictive modeling. Through this project, users can gain insights into the process of building predictive models to estimate the survival chances of individuals during the Titanic disaster, a historically significant event.

## Features

- Predictive Model: The program includes a predictive model that leverages data and machine learning techniques to estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. The model is based on various features, allowing users to explore the factors influencing survival rates.

## Tools Used

To create this project and perform data analysis, we used the following tools and libraries:

üêç Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and model development.

üìä Numpy: A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.

üêº Pandas: A versatile data analysis library for data manipulation and analysis.

ü§ñ Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): A robust library for machine learning, offering tools for predictive modeling, classification, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring the inner workings of this project and its data science components, you can follow the provided code in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
